1.  Introduction

   The IDC (Internet Delay Chat) protocol has been designed over a
   number of days for use with federated multimedia conferencing.  This
   document describes the current IDC protocol.

   IDC itself is a messaging system, which (through the use of the
   client-server and server-to-server model) is well-suited to running
   on many machines in a distributed fashion.  A typical setup involves
   multiple servers each with multiple clients, that connect to each
   other in order to exchange messages, in a multi-centered fashion.

   Internet Relay Chat as in RFC 1459 has been in use since May 1993, a
   very simple protocol for teleconferencing system.  Later updates such
   as RFC 2812 have been badly accepted.  It was not designed for
   personal instant messaging.

   IRC is real time.  When a client disconnects, the server no longer
   recognizes the client, and messages during the client's downtime are
   not saved.  This renders IRC unfit for instant messaging, where
   clients are forced to disconnect but messages are to be read later.

   SMS does not work over the Internet.
