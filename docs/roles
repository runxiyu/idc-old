A further draft

The below define channel permissions and how actions by users are
permitted or rejected.

1. Permissions

   Permissions allow users to perform actions that do not interfere with
   the permissions other users.
   
   - talk :: allow the user to talk
   - read :: allow the user to read the chat

2. Anti-permissions

   Anti-permissions cause the user to be unable to exercise a matching
   permission, even if their role contains the said permission.  There
   exists an anti-permission for each permission, with the name of the
   permission preceeded by a "-" (ASCII 0x2D HYPHEN-MINUS) character.

   - -talk :: causes the user to be unable to talk
   - -read :: causes the user to be deafened

3. Roles

   Roles are sets of permissions, anti-permissions and management
   permissions (as defined in section 4).  Users may have multiple
   roles and must at least have one role.

   Note that the examples below note an example setup.  Those with the
   "roles" management permission may customize these, as noted in
   section 4.

   - student :: talk, read
   - teacher :: talk, read, mute, deafen, ban
   - administrator :: talk, read, mute, deafen, kick, ban

3. Management Permissions

## Space Roles

Roles designate the power of a given user in a space.  Each space must have a FOUNDER and a MEMBER role, where FOUNDER is a special role with all possible permissions within a space.  MEMBER is a special role given to all users who JOIN the space by default.  Roles are ordered, with FOUNDER always being the highest.

Roles have a set of permissions both within the scope of the whole space and specific channels in the space.  Roles may only utilize their permissions on users below their role.

## Permissions

Permissions designate what actions a role may perform in a space and its respective channels.  Permissions are granted by roles containing the permission.  Permissions are identified by a uppercase string that begins with +.

Space permissions are include:

  * +READ Be in the space;
  * +INTERACT Affect the space;
  * +MUTE Give a user with lower roles the -READ anti-permission.
  * +KICK Removes a user from the space;
  * +BAN Removes a user from the space, and prohibit them from re-joining;
  * +ROLES Manage roles of users with lower ranks, may only promote to the same rank as themself and demote users of lower ranks.


Channel permissions include:

  * +READ Read messages from the channel; Users without this permission is not considered to be in the channel;
  * +INTERACT Affect the channel;
  * +MUTE Give a user with lower roles the -MESSAGE anti-permission.
  * +BAN Give a user with lower roles the -READ anti-permission.


## Anti-permissions

Each permission has a corresponding anti-permission, named after the permission but replacing '+' with '-'.  When a user has an anti-permission, per ability to utilize the permission is lost even if perse has a role with the permission.
