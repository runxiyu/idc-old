okay im jsut saying that those specifications are really outdated
once we test things out and find something good implementation-wise,
i'll restart writing the docs

but here's the general message format


COMMAND	KEY1:ARG1	KEY2:ARG2 contains some spaces, a tab (\t), and a CR-LF (\r\n)

Here's an escape lookup table:

Thing    How-to-put-in-an-argument    Oringinal use
\        \\                           escaping
<Tab>    \t                           delimiting arguments
<CR>     \r                           part of CR-LF delimiting messages
<LF>     \n                           part of CR-LF delimiting messages
